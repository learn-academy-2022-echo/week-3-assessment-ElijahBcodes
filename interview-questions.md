# ASSESSMENT 3: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is JSX? What is one syntax difference between HTML and JSX?

Your answer: JSX is the language used in React library. It can use html, css, and JavaScript in one page. If you put curly braces around the code then it knows you are calling for Javascript and it acts accordingly. It has additional usages that HTML does not. It has a state property which can render UI actions in real time without having to refresh the browser. JSX uses components which can have data passed from the state to children using props. HTML is not as fast responsive or scalable for large applications. It does not have components, props or state. 

Researched answer: It is basically an  extension for Javascript. It is short for JavaScript XML.
This language was developed by Jordan Walke a developer at Facebook. This made it easier to code HTML elements in JS negating the use other methods. It is not necessary but very useful in React. 

2. What is yarn? What file(s) are modified in a React application when you run yarn?

Your answer: Yarn is something used in React to run the applications we build and see the UI in the DOM. I believe it stands for something close to Yet Another Resource Navigator. I know that we used the yarn to download dependencies and then yarn start to run the applications we are building in React. The yarn was very useful in developing React applications because we can test and implement changes in real time. Meaning that while we are adding functions or styles or anything for that matter the changes are rendered in real time. It allows us to run a server on our own. The files that are modified in the React app are the Src, App.js. Any files you basically alter in the file will be rendered in real time once you have run the yarn.

Researched answer: Yarn is open sourced.  It has all the dependencies needed to create a React App, lots of files and code snippets. Often referred to as a package manager. Yarn was a breakthrough that allowed to switch from the old node package manager. It is specifically meant to be used for Javascript. 

3. What is an anonymous function in JavaScript?

Your answer: An anonymous function in JavaScript is a function that does not have a name. I believe it lives inside of a component or another function. A function that runs dependent on another function. I know it doesn't have or need a name. 

Researched answer:Another definition of an anonymous function is a function that is stored in a variable and does not have or need a name. They are started by calling on the variables name. THey end with a semicolon and it can have many arguments but only one return.

4. What is the difference between a class and an object?

Your answer: A class is a blue print for objects. Objects are the key value pairs that hold data, like arrays. Objects are the intersection of data and actions. A good real life example to illustrate this is classes are like recipes and objects are what we can create with recipes. 

Researched answer: A class is just a blueprint for an object. For example if you have a class of Dogs we know that all dogs have a certain breed, color, size, age. Now if we look at a Boston Terrier dog for example the breed is Boston Terrier the size is small the age is xx so that dog itself is an object in the class of dogs which has its own attributes that are different from other dogs. 

5. What is the difference between state and props in React?

Your answer: State in react is something that is Set in the App.js and allows us to pass down information to components via props. Props cannot pass data back to the parent or state. State can call upon the value index or array of an object. 

Researched answer:State is used to manage data by using the setState() inside the parenthesis is where we pass the state we want to change. It can be used in classes and functions. States data is only available to the component. Props uses this data to pass down to components. 

6. STRETCH: Which is the difference between a div and a span?

Your answer: A div is a blockline element and a span is inline. Span will only take up one line where as a div will consume the entire block. While we don't use it often a <span> element can provide space where needed in an HTML doc.

Researched answer:DIVs aka division elements. DIVS take up the whole block and the span only takes up the part of the line selected. You can have more than one span on a line whereas you can only have one DIV per line or block . The divs come in handy when grouping similar paragraphs. SPan can be sued to style inline elements without affecting the rest of the code block. 

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. Object-oriented programming: A style that creates functions to act like objects. There is class based and also prototype. In class OOP the objects are created from classes.

2. Ruby: A coding language that took the best aspects of other programming languages and bundeled them into one. 

3. Implicit return:You don't need a return in a a function that has only one single expression.. 

4. Ruby blocks:Similar to a method but it is not part of an object. Has no name.

5. Ruby hashes: Basically a group of key value pairs.
